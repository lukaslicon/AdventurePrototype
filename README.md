A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name the classes).
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Scene 1 (Entrance), Scene 2 (Office), Scene 3(Upstairs), Scene 4(Bathroom)
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: In every scene you can interact between switching between chemicals and a fly swatter. You can also interact with the smoke in 2 rooms and the keys in the office and pick both up. All rooms have 2+, some rooms have 3.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Almost every object created within the game has pointerover messages where it either says what it is or a random message like "buzzzz" for flies and little tooltips for messages to the player like (hives give 3 points)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Almost all object in the game have pointerdown effects. All bugs have pointerdown effects and all arrows/doors do as well.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: I am using a lot of tween based functions so that I can
