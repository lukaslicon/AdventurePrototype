A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Scene1, Scene2, Scene3, Scene4
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, Outro1, Outro2
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - flyMovement(image) - this is in the repeated enhancement used in every pointerover call
    - destroyBug(image) I repeatedly use this to destroy bugs everytime they are clicked on
    - shakeObj(image) for shaking image items using a tween. I use this a few times.
    - shakeText(txt) for shaking text items using a tween. I use this a few times.
    - addSmoke(width, height) this was a useful enhancement that I wish I used earlier on to create all my bugs. I could have made an add function for every bug and replicated it across all of them.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Scene 1 (Entrance), Scene 2 (Office), Scene 3(Upstairs), Scene 4(Bathroom)
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: In every scene you can interact between switching between chemicals and a fly swatter. You can also interact with the smoke in 2 rooms and the keys in the office and pick both up. All rooms have 2+, some rooms have 3.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Almost every object created within the game has pointerover messages where it either says what it is or a random message like "buzzzz" for flies and little tooltips for messages to the player like (hives give 3 points)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Almost all object in the game have pointerdown effects. All bugs have pointerdown effects and all arrows/doors do as well.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: I am using a lot of tween based functions so that all the flies are moving and my images such as chemicals, smoke, and flyswatter all move. Also the hives and all bees have fadeOut tweens for whne they die.
