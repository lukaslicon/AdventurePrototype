A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name the classes).
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Scene 1 (Entrance), Scene 2 (Office), Scene 3(Upstairs), Scene 4(Bathroom)
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: In every scene you can interact between switching between chemicals and a fly swatter. You can also interact with the smoke in 2 rooms and the keys in the office and pick both up. All rooms have 2+, some rooms have 3.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Almost every object created within the game has pointerover messages where it either says what it is or a random message like "buzzzz" for flies and little tooltips for messages to the player like (hives give 3 points)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Almost all object in the game have pointerdown effects. All bugs have pointerdown effects and all arrows/doors do as well.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: I am using a lot of tween based functions so that all the flies are moving and my images such as chemicals, smoke, and flyswatter all move. Also the hives and all bees have fadeOut tweens for whne they die.

**Fly Swatter**: https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/fly-swatter-isolated-on-white-background-vector-31112920 I cut one of the two fly swatters out into a new image then removed the white background and white squares in between meshing holes.
